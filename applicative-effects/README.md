Code samples from my series of posts on representing effects using applicative functors.

To install, clone this project and run `npm i && npm run build` in this directory.

The series of examples involving the evaluation of expressions is based on an example given in the paper "Applicative Programming with Effects" by Conor McBride and Ross Paterson.
