Code samples from [this](https://medium.com/@JosephJnk/building-a-functional-parsing-library-in-javascript-and-flow-7d738088237f) post.

To install, clone this project and run `npm i && npm run build` in this directory.

The library implemented here is heavily based on the Haskell library described in Graham Hutton's paper ["Higher-Order Functions for Parsing"](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6669/f223fba59edaeed7fabe02b667809a5744d9.pdf).
